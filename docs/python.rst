Python and Python Packages
**************************

The `ocean-carbon`_ package is compatible with Python 3. It relies on several packages including **xarray** and **dask** which include codes to load, plot, and perform calculations on GEOS-NOBM output. 

Why Python?
-----------

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is an easy to learn, open-source programming language. In addition to the standard language library, there are thousands of free third-party packages available on code repositories such as <https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo>`_ and `Conda Forge <https://conda-forge.org/feedstock-outputs/>`_. Python is free for everyone to use, unlike programming languages like Matlab and IDL.

Installing Python
-----------------

There are several ways of installing Python on your machine. You can install compiled binaries directly from the  `Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/>`_, or one can install via a package manager such as Anaconda or Miniconda. I personally find the Anaconda or Miniconda route to be simplest.
