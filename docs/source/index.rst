Welcome to the *ocean-carbon* Tutorial 
--------------------------------------

This website contains a set of tutorials about how to use *ocean-carbon*, an open-source, multi-model validation tool that can be used to evaluate the performance of ocean biogeochemical models. The tutorials were written in Python and make use of the `ocean-carbon` Python library, a library written specifically for loading, plotting, and analyzing ocean biogeochemical model output and comparing it to ocean carbon observations. 

Additional Resources
--------------------
The `ocean-carbon`_ package used in this tutorial was inspired by the `WeatherBench`_ and `ILAMB`_ toolboxes.
