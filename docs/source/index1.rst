Welcome to the ocean-carbon Tutorial 
====================================

This website contails a set of tutorials about how to use *ocean-carbon*, an open-source, multi-model validation tool that can be used to evaluate the performance of ocean biogeochemical models. The tutorials were written in Python and make use of the `ocean-carbon` Python library, a library written specifically for loading, plotting, and analyzing ocean biogeochemical model output and comparing it to ocean carbon observations.
